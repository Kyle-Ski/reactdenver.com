We do our best NOT to fill your inbox, but we have a lot of news to share. To better manage communications, we've started a newsletter where you can opt-in to these emails!

Sign up if you're interested: https://buttondown.email/reactdenver

You will still receive meetup announcements from Meetup.com. We've already disabled the Discussions feature to reduce recruiter spam.

We plan to send a recap email after each monthly meetup. Wondering what to expect? Here's a link to our first edition. Be sure to check out our t-shirt plans and links to upcoming events, including conference/workshop discounts. We hope our newsletter will be valuable to you.
