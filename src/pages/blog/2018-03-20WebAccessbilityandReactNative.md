Create Mobile Apps using React-Native with Expo & Snack by Rahim Rahman

Whether you're just starting out or a seasoned React-Native developer, here's your chance to learn more about Expo & one of Expo's development tools: Snack. Expo is the fastest way to build native iOS & Android apps using Javascript and React. We'll talk a little bit about React-Native in general, go through getting started with Expo, write some sloppy code and publish 1-2 apps that you can download (hopefully not another Todo app) to your iPhone or Android devices.

Rahim Rahman is a Full Stack Developer with Aptos, Inc., and currently focuses on helping with the mobile application development efforts using React-Native.
