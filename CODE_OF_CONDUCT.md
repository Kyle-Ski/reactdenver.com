##Principles

React Denver is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of React Denver participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the Denver React organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from React Denver. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of React Denver staff immediately.

##Events

React Denver staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment.

##Online

In addition to the principles outlined above, participants are also asked to refrain from recruiting through React Denver communications. Because demand for developers greatly outstrips supply, allowing recruiting through React Denver would reduce the quality of the community and its discussions.
